//Question 1

//Make a variable with a data of a string and check the type of this variable

// let firstName = "Neriah"
// console.log(typeof firstName); 
//Answer : string

//Reassign the value to a number and check the type again. Did it change?

// let firstName = 2
// console.log(typeof firstName);

//Answer : number

//Go ahead and create a variable with every data type you know of. Double check that you covered all of them by using the typeof check.

//Strings
let lastName = "Petersen"
console.log(typeof lastName);

//Numbers
let height = 1.6
console.log(typeof height);

//Booleans
let acceptance = true 
console.log(typeof acceptance);

//Undefined
let age = undefined 
console.log(typeof age);

//Null
let color ;
console.log(typeof color)

//Objects 
let selectedColor = null
console.log(typeof selectedColor)
